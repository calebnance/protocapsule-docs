React Native/Expo is one of the fastest ways to get prototypes in the hands of working teams, stakeholders, and user testers.

With protocapsule, I tried to make it even easier for a developer to internally share **multiple end-to-end experiences** or simple microinteractions with anyone on their working team.

For example, your dev team is supporting multiple design teams that have a screen or experience they want user tested or in the hands of stakeholders and a figma/invision prototype just isn't cutting it.

Loading the experience into protocapsule, you can simply give access via **TestFlight** or **.apk**. Because this is using expo's managed workflow, all future code pushes (via `expo publish`) the user will get from [over-the-air](https://docs.expo.io/build/updates/) updates the next time they open the app! Ensuring your working team always have the latest and greatest from your dev team.

## Key takeaways:

- View and manage apps and microinteractions in one app.
- Design team/working team can see the developers progress and what other design teams are doing.
- A great way to store old apps/experiences for future reference!
- Real code, on a real device, great for user testing sessions.
- You only need to give access to this one app (via TestFlight or .apk sharing), rather than each time you create a new experience or app.

## What you get

- protocapsule built with:
  - Managed Expo SDK 40
  - React Navigation v4
- Design files to help with rebranding of protocapsule for your teams usage.
