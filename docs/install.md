## Requirements

Now that you have downloaded **protocapsule**, there are a few steps to take before running the application.

Make sure you have these installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/#installing-expo-cli)

## Install & Build

Now let's navigate to the **protocapsule** root directory and run:

```bash
yarn
```

Once **protocapsule** is installed on your machine, you can now build and run it on a simulator or device (download [Expo Go](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/#2-expo-go-app-for-ios-and) to run on your physical device).

```bash
yarn dev
```
