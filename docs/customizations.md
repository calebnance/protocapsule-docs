Let's say you have an app loaded into protocapsule, you are user testing an authenticated flow and on your apps home screen, there is a place for a user's name to display.

I've added the ability to edit this user's name within the **Settings** screen of protocapsule.

This way you don't have to touch any code in-between users tests, but also your User Testing team can quickly edit this name before each user testing session!

**In the future**, there will be more customizations options as they appear as needs.
