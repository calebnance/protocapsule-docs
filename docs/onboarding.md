By default, protocapsule comes with an onboarding experience.

It is displayed the **first time** a user visits the app, and then any time after that it can be accessed from the **Settings** screen if the user wants to have a refresher.

I added this to the project because it **will save you time** (as a developer) to not have to explain to the user how protocapsule works, how to get out of a full app experience with **three finger touch**, etc.
